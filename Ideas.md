# Ideas

This file contains a more in-depth description of the plans and ideas I have for this project.

## Compiling & Interpreting

Unlike the original where commands could be executed live on a console-like interface, LightASM will now take a file as an input, compile it and run. 

## lasmc

`lasmc` will be used to compile a file, for example `program.lasm`, and will produce a 'binary' in the format of `program.lbin`. These files will contain the compiled instructions from the given file, which can then be run in the virtual machine.

[More details soon]

## Virtual Machine

`lasmvm` will be used to run a compiled `.lbin` file in the LightASM virtual machine.

[More details soon]
